commands to check java versions 
 
 - java -version
 - javac -version

 Rules to create a basic java program

  1. In java all the codes is written inside a class.


  2. The class name should be in upper camel case .


  3. First define the scope of class then write the code inside {  } .


  4. The file name must be same as the class name that contains the main method.


  5. The extension of the file should be .java .

  6. The execution of the code starts from main().

  7. The main must have the signature: .

    public static void main (String []args )

    -- What variations can work?

    - public static void main (String [] args )
    - static public void main (String [] args)
    - public static void mainn (String... args) 
    - public static void main (String ... hii)

  8. The name of variables should be in lower lower camel case .

  9. The names must be meaningful.


  10. Every java program runs in 2 steps :

     step 1 : Compile the programme 
     Command l: java<name of the file>.java 

     Step 2 : Run the executable 
     command : java <name of the executable >

  11. To run a program , it must have a main method 
      The programe without main() will compile but won't run.

   12. Java is class based langauge . There are 2  types of clases :
       1. pre-defined classes ( EXA: String,Scanner,System)

       2. User defined classes 

   13. Variable Declaration : Every variable must be declared before using it .

        there are two types of variables 
        1.Pre-defined Variables (EXA: our and in)

        2.User defined vaiables (EXA: args , scanner )

        USAGE
        --------
        System.in means getting input from keyboard on console
        System.out means printing output on console

        Scanner creates a connection between our java programme and console.

        String[] args is used to pass data to the main method as command line argument.

       Data types
       ------------
       We have to specify the type of data that a variable is going to hold well in advance.
       - This is known as static typing
       - Java is a statically  and strongly typed langauge

    Static langauges ex: Java, C,C++
    Dynamic langauge ex: Javascript, Python
     
There are two types of data types:
 1. Primitive data types
   Integer data types (5) Int,byte ,short,long,char 
   - Used to hold integer values of different range 
   - variable declaration:

     byte b = 1
     short s = 2;
     int i  = 4;
     long l = 10;
     char c = '@';

     - Decimal data types (2) : float , double
     - variable decleration 
     
     float f = 1.2f;
     float f = 1.2F;
     double d = 1.2;
      
 - We cannot assing data of bigger type integer variable of smaller data type 

 - Double is bigger than float and all decimal numbers are automatically considered double 

 -Hence we have to explicitly tell java that a decimal number is not double by appending f/F to it     

Boolean data types 
-------------------

 boolean ispassed = true;
 boolean isabsent = false;

2. Refrence data types 
   1. Class
   2. Interface 
   3. Enum 
   4. Array

Class
-----------
 Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)
 System.out.println

 EXA: scanner,out ,in 

Array
--------------
 String [] args
 args is array refrence type 

~ Methods
--------
 Syntax:
 <access-modifier><non-access modifier> <return-type><name-of-method>(<parameters-list>){

    //processing
    //stmt1..
    //stmt2..
    //stmtn..

    // return statement ;

 }
 Exa: access-modifier => public 
 Exa:  non-access modifier=> static
 Exa:  return type => void 
 Exa : name of method => main
 Exa : parameters-liat => String [] args 

 -Inorder to access main from any folder .it is decalred public
 -Inorder to access main without creating a reference , it is declared static  

 EXA : main() , print() , println() , nextInt() , nextFloat() , Scanner()

~ \n is used for line break 
~ println() is used to give a line break after printing the statements 

Ques - WAP to to calculate body mass index(BMI)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifiers 
------------
 The names that we give to classes ,interfaces ,objects, variables , methods , enums are called identifiers 
 
  Rules:
   - We can use a-z,A-Z,0-9,_,$ as an identifiers 
   - the identifier cannot start with a number 
   - we can create an identifer of any length
   - Keywords cannot be used as identifiers 
   - Space is not allowed in a name 
   
  Exa : dellLaptop_001Screen , _productId , $price .

Keyword 
--------
 These are pre-defined , reserved words that have special meanings to the compiler .
 There are 65+ keywords in java .
  Exa : class, public, static, void, int, float, etc .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~> JVM is platform independent , we need different JVM instalaation for different OS .

=> JDK , JRE  , JVM .

 >>>> JDK 
   - JDK stands for java devlopment kit .
   - it is software devlopment enviroment used to devlop  java application .
   > it inludes :
     1. Java Runtime Enviroment (JRE).
     2. Interpreter .
     3. Compiler.
     4. Archiever.
     5. Documantion generator (Javadoc) and
     6. Other tools needen in java devlopment

>>>> JRE 
  -JRE stands for java runtime enviroment . Sometimes it is also reffered as Java RTE .
  - The java runtime enviroment provides the minimum requirements for executing a java application .
  - It consists of JVM , core classes, and supporting files .

>>>> JVM 
   - JVM stands for java virtual machine .
   - when we execute a java program , a runtime instance of JVM executes the java byte code . 

~ SUMMARY
   > JDK = JRE + Devlopment tools 
   > JRE = JVM + Runtime Library

Operators 
===========
   6 + 7
    Operand : The values on which operation is done are operands  , 6 and 7 are operands .
    Operator: The operation on operands is done bt operator . Here + is the operator.

 Types of Operators 
 -------------------
    - Unary Operators
    - Binary Operators
    - Ternary Operators
 Unary Operators
 ----------------
 there are 5 unary Operators:
   1.++(Increment Operators)
   2.--(Decreament Operators)
   3. +()
   4. -()
   5. !()
 Binary Operators
 -----------------
 there are 4 types of binary operators 
 1. Arithmetic operators(+ , - , * , / , %)
 -they works on numbers and retrurn a numaber 

2.Relational Operators(< , > , <= , >= , == , !=)
- they works on numbers and return a boolean value 

3. Logical Operators( $,| , !)
- they works on boolean and return and boolean ......

Short circuit logical Operators : && and || 

&& - It will not evaluate the expression on RHS  if LHS is false and the final answer will be false .
     - true & true => true 
    - true & false => false 
    -    false & true => false
    - false & false => false


|| - It will not evaluate the expression on RHS if LHS is true and the final answer will be true .

     - true | true => true 
    - true | false => true
    - false | true => true 
    - false | false => false

Assingment Operators
----------------------
Simple Assingment Operators
----------------------------
SAO assings the value of expression on RHS into variable on LHS 

int total = n1 + n2;
n1 + n2 ; 9 (Wrong)

Compound Assingment operators
------------------------------
      1. x= x + 10 => x+= =>  Compound Addition Operator
      2. x = x - 10 => x -=10 Compound subtract Operator
      3. x= x * 10 => x*= =>  Compound Multiplication  Operator
      4. x = x / 10 => x /=10 Compound  Quotient Operator
      5.  x = x / 10 => x /=10 Compound  Modulus t Operator  


Control statements
===================

There are 2 types of control statements 

1. Decision control statements 
2. Repetition statements 

Decision Control  statements
-----------------------------
There are 2 Decision Control statements
    1. if - else
    2. switch case default 

Repetition statements
---------------------
    1.while 
    2. do-while 
    3. for 
    4. for each 
    5. Enhanced for

    ARRAYs
